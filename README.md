# Hi I'm Daniël 👋
👀 I’m interested in: 

- Software development
- Web development
- Back-end development.

💞️ I have worked with and finished projects in:

- HTML & CSS
- Processing 3.0
- Java
- C#
- JavaScript (Node, Gatsby, React)

🌱 I’m currently focusing on learning Web-Development: Javascript, Node, React, Gatsby.

🌱 It's late 2021 and it's back to school time, I will have much less time for side projects.
