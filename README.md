# Hi I'm Daniël 👋
👀 I’m interested in: 

- Software development
- Web development
- Back-end development.

💞️ I have worked with and finished projects in:

- HTML & CSS
- Processing 3.0
- Java
- C#
- JavaScript (Node, Gatsby, React)
- SQL

🌱 It's late 2021 and it's back to school time, I will have much less time for side projects.

🌱 Currently learning: SQL, PHP.
